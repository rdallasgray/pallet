;;; Commentary:
;;
;; [Carton](https://github.com/rejeep/carton.git) is a dependency manager for Emacs, which is gaining currency especially in new Elisp projects.
;; It provides a simple format for creating manifest files, and a set of functionality to install and update packages
;; (as well as some very useful utilities for package *development*).
;;
;; The piece missing from Carton is the functionality to create and maintain a manifest file *in tandem* with package.el,
;; Emacs' built-in package system.
;;
;; You can, of course, manually maintain your Carton (manifest) file, but most of us like to use `M-x package-list-packages`
;; to discover and install packages. Pallet lets you do exactly this.
;;
;; `M-x pallet-init` will look at your installed packages and source archives and create a valid Carton file in your Emacs directory.
;; You now no longer need to keep your `/elpa` directory under version control; simply keep your Carton file under version
;; control, and use Carton to keep your packages synchronised across Emacs installs.
;;
;; Pallet will update your Carton file when you install or delete an archived package using package.el, or when you run `M-x pallet-repack`, so you can use
;; `M-x list-packages` to install and delete packages as normal.
;;
;; You can install your Carton-managed packages using `pallet-install`, and update them using `pallet-update`.
;; These commands are just interactive aliases of the relevant Carton functions.
;;
;;
;; See the README for more details.
